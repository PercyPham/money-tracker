# Money Tracker

## Start

Before starting the app, we must define some values for the `.env` file. It has structure as below:

```
MONGODB_DEV_URL="xxxxxxxxxx"
MONGODB_PROD_URL="xxxxxxxxxx"

DEV_BASE_URL="xxxxxxxxxx"
PROD_BASE_URL="xxxxxxxxxx"
```

Now, we can run the app:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
